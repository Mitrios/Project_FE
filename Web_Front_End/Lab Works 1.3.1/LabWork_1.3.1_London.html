	<h1>London</h1>
	<br>
	<p>London is the capital and most populous city of <b>England</b> and the <b>United Kingdom</b>. Standing on the River Thames in the southeast of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for <b>two millennia</b>. Londinium was founded by the <b>Romans</b>. London's ancient core, <b>the City of London</b>, which covers an area of only 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2), largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, a region governed by the <b>Mayor of London</b> and <b>the London Assembly.</b></p>
